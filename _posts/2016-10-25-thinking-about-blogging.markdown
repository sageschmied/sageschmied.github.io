I just spent some time checking out other archaeology blogs, and it was definitely interesting to see what there is out there in terms of archaeology in the digital world, especially in a platform that is so readily used and accessible. I thought it was interesting to see how the authors engaged in their fields of study and their work in a non-academic setting. It definitely got me thinking about my interests and what I would want to add to this blog and continue to do with it as it progresses. I think it is important to have this information more accessible and in a comprehensible way, even for academics trying to do research or trying to think through things, these blogs offer cool insights and links to many different perspectives that are useful for understanding. I really appreciate the news aspect of these blogs, when they talk about new research or some news article found that talks to something they are interested in. It is also nice to know that there is a lot of things going on outside of the realm of academia that are so well received by the public. 
Here are the blogs I looked at and that I hope I can make this blog further resemble:

https://bonesdontlie.wordpress.com/blog-posts/

The only problem is it seems harder to find news and research on something so specific as lithics, since for research of a site it is usually within that report and for new articles it is not a very big thing to talk about in a new story.. so who knows what I will find! I'm looking though.
Thanks for reading,
