I am currently thinking about the visualization tools that I want to incorporate into my website. I have space for them but I am thinking that the idea I have in my head are not exactly going to turn out the way I want them to. I also need to make my website more appealing, link all my other pages and data and create my references place for my citations. My friend wanted me to add a section on my website about telling the difference between normal stones and stone tools so I am going to have to figure that out. I have kinda thought it might be cool to do some experimental archaeology with making tools and make a video and upload that...however that will be quite the time commitment so I might just put a few links from some professionals. I think this will be important because it can really show people what it is I am talking about and I really do want to make this as engaging and accurate as possible. I just have to commit my time on making it so! I am really excited about what I have made and I think I have a good starting point. I think I might link my website to my large report on lithics, or upload it to here because that is also something I am proud of and it is more contextual, anyways we will see!
