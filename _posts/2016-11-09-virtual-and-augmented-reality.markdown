I think that virtual and augmented reality is the coolest thing. Who does not love going to the museum and playing with all the things they have that let you interact and manipulate things? Honestly, I love the idea of being able to be somewhere and then put on a pair of glasses and be transported somewhere else. That is why it is so exciting for me to be able to create things along these lines. The only issue is that it is not the easiest thing to do with my theme of lithics. I think I am going to try to make 3D models of some tools, hopefully tools I have worked with, because that would be the neatest thing to have that on my website. However, if that does not work out I will probably make some sort of story about stone tools being made using the application Twine. I hope the 3D model works out though because that would be really neat to have something like that for my friends and family to be able to interact with objects that I get to interact with daily.
