So my next move is to make an awesome map for the site. I want to make it aesthetically pleasing and interactive. On trying to decide the content for my map, I tried to pick a topic that was going to be the most useful communicating tool to my audience. That being said, I also wanted it to make sense and answer questions that I have gotten about lithics and the sites they come from. I have decided to make my map on the Barkley Sound region of Vancouver Island, since that is where I have done archaeology and that is a place that has very well done reports on the sites present there. I have this information for at least four sites in the area and I want to make my map on the frequency of lithic assemblages at these sites. This is important to understand because it gives context to all the sites and allows there to be a comparison and also by looking at he amount and types of lithics, its possible to speculate what those sites were used for in relation to each other, but also it helps to confirm what oral histories may say about those sites. I hope to make an engaging and interesting map and perhaps will try to add in some more information on the cultures that these sites belong to, and really give a connection to the peoples who's stories these sites represent and still are representing. Hopefully it works out and looks professional!
