I just completed my map on Lithic assemblage frequencies in Barkley Sound. I am really pleased with how it turned out, and it is exactly what I wanted. I had some issues along the way, mainly in using carto and uploading my data. My first issue was that my data had to be in decimal degrees which was not clear to me until after I uploaded my first data file. I also struggled with which numbers were longitude and latitude and I forgot about the negative sign, for longitude? latitude? I am not sure... 
Anyways, I am pleased how it turned out and I like that it was easy to decide what information and what I wanted the map buttons to say. If I had pictures of the sites I could have included them, but that is not ethical in my mind, I know especially it was important to keep the location of Hupkisakuu7a exactly, a secret. None of my points exactly line up with where they would be, so that is another ethical concern that was taken into consideration. The points are on the right island and that in my mind is enough. I also thought it was important to include the First Nations groups and their websites on the page for further understanding of who's history is being discussed and the fact that these places may not be occupied now but they were not long ago and there are contemporary people that belong to these places and whose land it is. 
My map can be found under the "view more items" button under "for further information" on my home page, or directly here:
