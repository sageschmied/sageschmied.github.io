This blog was created in order to share and create digital archaeology material. The main goal of this blog is to create a public platform in which the public can view and participate in archaeology in a way that is viewer friendly. The first project that will be launched and discussed in this blog will be a website concerned with the discussion of lithics (stone tools). This work will aim to demonstrate terminology, the creation of these tools and examples of the various rock types which they are made from, among other things. 

I hope this work is received in good favor and thank you for checking it out!
